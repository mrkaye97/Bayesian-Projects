# Bayesian-Projects

Various projects from MATH 315: Topics in Bayesian Statistics. These projects are runnable versions of my answers to the R portions of the homework questions throughout the term.

Each folder contains a PDF of the assignment, as well as all of the necessary R and data files.

The textbook for this course was McElreath's Statistical Rethinking.
